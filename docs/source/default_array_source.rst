Default array geometry and source positions
===========================================
The `tact` package has its origins in a calibration experiment carried out at the LMU Munich 
with acoustic tracking methods used in the Acoustic and Functional Ecology Group (MPI for Ornithology, Seewiesen). 
The default array geometry and source positions reflect these!

The default array geometry: tristar
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The `tristar` array geometry is any array with 4 microphones with one mic in the centre
and three peripheral mics placed at the ends of an inverted T at the same radial distance
from the central mic. The tristars are named after the radial distance in centimeters. The
default `tact` tristar is a 60cm tristar. All coordinates form a right-hand coordinate system. 

The positions of the microphones are below in metres.

The default source positions
>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
The default source position set comes from a calibration experiment run in the corridors of the LMU BioZentrum, 
with a speaker at various distances from the array, and the array being turned in the azimuth and elevation. 

The source positions are below in metres.
